# Flight Survey Interface

This project is an implementation of Minh Pham's design which can be found [here](https://dribbble.com/shots/5362972-Airlines-Survey).

Credit also goes to Marcin SzaÅ‚ek who kindly explained the concepts needed to make this design possible Through [his Flutter Europe talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCyoHclCqc8&t=1425s) and also made the source code available [through his github page.](https://github.com/MarcinusX/flight_survey) 

> __NOTE :__  This project is not a copy paste of his code. However, I used as a guide to practice the concepts I learnt from it and to use Bloc for state management rather than setState(), which was used in his code. 


## Implementation

The goal of building this UI is to show how flutter can be used to build complex designs easily.

- The questions page was built using custom animations.
- Bloc package was used for state managment.

> __NOTE :__ The focus was to implement the animations but not to make the screens responsive that's why the design will be off on other devices other than the one I used that's why I included the preview here to demonstrate how it looks.
